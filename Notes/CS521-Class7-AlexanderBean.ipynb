    "### Variable Scope and the LEGB Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variable scope** in Python refers to the region in a program where a variable is recognized and can be accessed.\n",
    "- The scope of a variable determines its visibility and lifetime.\n",
    "- Based on where a variable is declared, it may be accessible only within a certain part of the program.\n",
    "- The **LEGB Rule** helps determine which variable Python will use when there are multiple variables with the same name.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LEGB rule is the method Python uses to resolve variables names based on their scope. Python looks for variables in the following order:\n",
    "1. **Local Scope (L)**\n",
    "- The innermost scope, where variables are defined inside a function or lambda expression.\n",
    "- These variables can only be accessed within that function or lambda.\n",
    "2. **Enclosing Scope (E)**\n",
    "- In the case of nested functions, the enclosing function’s scope is checked if the variable is not found in the local scope.\n",
    "- These variables are also sometimes called \"non-local\" variables.\n",
    "3. **Global Scope (G)**\n",
    "- Variables defined at the top level of a module or script, or explicitly declared global inside a function.\n",
    "- These are accessible throughout the module\n",
    "4. **Built-in Scope (B)**\n",
    "- The outermost scope, which contains Python's built-in functions and constants (like len(), range(), etc.)"
