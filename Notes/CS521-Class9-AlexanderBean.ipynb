    "- You are tasked with developing a Python program that allows two players to play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.\n",
    "- The game will alternate between two players, displaying the board after every move.\n",
    "- The players will take turns inputting the position they wish to play on the 3x3 grid.\n",
    "- The program will ensure that no player can select a position that has already been played.\n",
    "- After every move, the program will check for a winner or a tie and display the appropriate message."

    "Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tic-Tac-Toe Board**\n",
    "- The game should represent a 3x3 grid. The board will initially be empty, and each cell can be filled with either an 'X' or 'O', depending on which playerâ€™s turn it is.\n",
    "2. **Two Players**\n",
    "- Player 1 will be assigned 'X'.\n",
    "- Player 2 will be assigned 'O'.\n",
    "- Players alternate turns.\n",
    "3. **Input Validation**\n",
    "- On each turn, the player will enter the position where they want to place their marker (X or O).\n",
    "- Positions will be represented by numbers [1][1] to [3][3] corresponding to each of the 9 cells of the board.\n",
    "- If a player tries to play in a cell that has already been occupied, the program should prompt the player to choose a different cell.\n",
    "4. **Game Rules**\n",
    "- The program will check after each move whether a player has won the game or if there is a tie.\n",
    "- Winning: A player wins if they can place three of their markers in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line.\n",
    "- Tie: The game ends in a tie if all cells are filled and neither player has won.\n",
    "5. **Board Display**\n",
    "- After each move, the program should display the current state of the board.\n",
    "6. **Game End**\n",
    "- The game should end when a player wins or if there is a tie. Display a message indicating the winner or if the game ended in a tie."

    "4. check_tie(board) : Checks if the game is a tie (i.e., the board is full with no winner).\n",

    "Steps to Complete Assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define the Board:\n",
    "- Represent the board using a 2D list (indexed from user input).\n",
    "2. Display the Board:\n",
    "- [1][1] to [3][3] for easier Write a function that will output the current state of the board after every move.\n",
    "3. Handle Player Input:\n",
    "- Write code that allows a player to input their choice of position as a pair of coordinates separated by a space (e.g. 2<space>3 ). Validate this input to ensure the player is not choosing a position that is already taken.\n",
    "4. Alternate Between Players:\n",
    "- Create a system that alternates turns between Player 1 ('X') and Player 2 ('O').\n",
    "5. Check for Winner or Tie:\n",
    "- Write functions to check whether a player has won (horizontal, vertical, diagonal win conditions) or if the game has resulted in a tie.\n",
    "6. End the Game:\n",
    "- End the game if there is a winner or a tie and display an appropriate message."
