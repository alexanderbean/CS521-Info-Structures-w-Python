    "Banks lend money to each other. In tough economic times, if a bank goes bankrupt, it may not be able to pay back the loan. A bank’s total assets are its current balance plus its loans to other banks. The diagram in the figure below shows five banks. The banks’ current balances are 25, 125, 175, 75, and 181 million dollars. The arrow from Bank 1 to Bank 2 indicates that Bank 1 lends 40 million dollars to Bank 2. \n",

    "It then sequentially reads n lines (given by the user) that describe the information for n banks with ids from 0 to n-1. The first number in the line is the bank’s balance, the second number indicates the number of banks that borrowed money from the bank, and the rest are tuples containing pairs of numbers. Each pair describes a borrower. The first number in the pair is the borrower’s id and the second is the amount borrowed. \n",

    "For example, the information for the five banks in the figure should be stored as follows (assume limit = $201 million): [ [5, 201], [25, 2, (1,100.5), (4,320.5)], [125, 2, (2, 40), (3, 85)], [175, 2, (0, 125), (3, 75)], [75, 1, (0, 125)], [181, 1, (2,125)], ] \n",

    "- The total assets of Bank 3 are (75+125) which is less than 201, so Bank 3 is declared “unsafe,” which means that it will probably not be able to pay back its lenders.\n",
    "- This now renders Bank 1 unsafe as well, since it can no longer rely on Bank 3 to repay the $85 million. This means, its total assets are, effectively, only (125+40) which is also less than 201. So, your function should output: Unsafe Banks are 3 1.\n",
